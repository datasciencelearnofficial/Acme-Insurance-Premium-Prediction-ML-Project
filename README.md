Acme Insurance Premium Prediction - Machine Learning Project : Using Linear Regression 👇

🛠️ Tools Used:
I used Python for building a Machine Learning Model to determine the annual insurance premium (amount paid every month) offered to the customers.

👩🏻‍💻 Work Process:
1. Explore the data and find correlations between inputs and targets
2. Pick the right model, loss functions and optimizer for the problem at hand
3. Scale numeric variables and one-hot encode categorical data
4. Set aside a test set (using a fraction of the training set)
5. Train the model using Linear Regression
6. Make predictions on the test set and compute the loss
